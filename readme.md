ABSTRACT = {Fine-grained recognition has many applications in many fields and aims to identify targets from subcategories. This is a highly challenging task due to the minor differences between subcategories. Both modal missing and adversarial sample attacks are easily encountered in fine-grained recognition tasks based on multimodal data. These situations can easily lead to the model needing to be fixed. An Enhanced Framework for the Complementarity of Multimodal Features (EFCMF) is proposed in this study to solve this problem. The modelâ€™s learning of multimodal data complementarity is enhanced by randomly deactivating modal features in the constructed multimodal fine-grained recognition model. The results show that the model gains the ability to handle modal missing without additional training of the model and can achieve 91.14% and 99.31% accuracy on Birds and Flowers datasets. The average accuracy of EFCMF on the two datasets is 52.85%, which is 27.13% higher than that of Bi-modal PMA when facing four adversarial example attacks, namely FGSM, BIM, PGD and C&W. In the face of missing modal cases, the average accuracy of EFCMF is 76.33% on both datasets respectively, which is 32.63% higher than that of Bi-modal PMA. Compared with existing methods, EFCMF is robust in the face of modal missing and adversarial example attacks in multimodal fine-grained recognition tasks.
